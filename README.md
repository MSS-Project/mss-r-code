See (About R)[https://www.r-project.org/about.html]

## How do set R on my computer?

- [ ] Download R

https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
You choose the mirror or the location you will download packages from. I chose https://cloud.r-project.org/ If you choose this mirror as well then follow https://cloud.r-project.org/ and select the installation based on your OS.

- [ ] Download RStudio
This is highly recommended unless you want to do troubleshooting via command line.

## Package Installation
You will need to open a script in R and run the following commands

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("needs")
install.packages("RMySQL")
install.packages("jsonlite")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("funnelR")
```
